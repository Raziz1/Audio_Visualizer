## Overview
The following project is a music visualizer which utilizes the Processing (graphics library for Java) library and Minim (Audio processing) library. This project uses your devices microphone as an audio input source and analyzes the incoming frequencies. This project displays frequency bands and a beat circle with a gradient color. The gradient color on the frequency bands is dependent on the amplitude. The higher the amplitude the more red is colored into the gradient. For the beat circle, every time a beat is detected the circle expands and is colored with a gradient which is dependent on the radius of the circle. (See the code for a more detailed explanation)
